# Ryan Scherr's Portfolio Page

## Description

This portfolio page was created to show off Ryan Scherr's ablities as a coder. The webpage will be updated throughout his time in JHU's program with new techniques, languages, and more.

The page tells users a short bit about Ryan's history, shows off projects he has made, and gives several ways to contact him. A navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to quikly jump to the information they are seeking, and clicking on images of his projects will take users to them. In addition, the HTML on this page were written with semantics in mind, ensuring high accessibility.
